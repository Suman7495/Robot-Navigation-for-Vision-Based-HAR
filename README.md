# Robot Navigation for Vision Based Human Activity Recognition
This project is a part of the Caresses project whose goal is to design elderly assistive robots that adapt their behaviour according to the culture of the human subject. Particularly, it is an improvement of a previous work where Aldebaran's Pepper robot was used for vision-based Human Activity Recognition.

We proposed a parabolic waypoint navigation strategy to optimize the representativeness of images taken by the robot's on-board camera for vision-based Human Activity Recognition.
